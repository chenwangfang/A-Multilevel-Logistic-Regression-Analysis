# Hypothesis 1: Dual Mechanism of Frame Activation
## Results
### Descriptive Statistics
Frame activation strength ranged from 3.20 to 6.40 (*M* = 4.94, *SD* = 0.60). The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated that activation strength was not normally distributed (*W* = 0.989, *p* < .001). 
### Multilevel Mixed-Effects Model
The three-level linear mixed model revealed significant main effects. Context dependence significantly predicted frame activation strength (*b* = -1.473, *SE* = 0.296, *p* < .001). Institutional presetting also showed a significant positive effect (*b* = 0.571, *SE* = 0.131, *p* < .001). 
The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.322, indicating that 32.2% of the variance in activation strength was attributable to between-dialogue differences. 
### Model Comparison
The M0 vs M1 comparison showed significant improvement (χ²(2) = 717.12, *p* < .001). The M1 vs M2 comparison showed significant improvement (χ²(1) = 21.14, *p* < .001). The M2 vs M3 comparison showed significant improvement (χ²(3) = 280.65, *p* < .001). The M3 vs M4 comparison showed significant improvement (χ²(8) = 114.28, *p* < .001). 
### Effect Sizes
The interaction effect showed a small effect size (*f*² = 0.114). 
### Simple Slopes Analysis
Post-hoc simple slopes analysis revealed stage-specific patterns: In the opening stage, context dependence (*b* = -1.927, *p* < .001). In the information_exchange stage, context dependence (*b* = -2.433, *p* < .001). In the negotiation_verification stage, context dependence (*b* = -2.446, *p* < .001). In the closing stage, context dependence (*b* = -2.767, *p* < .001).
