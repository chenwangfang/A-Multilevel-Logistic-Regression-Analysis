Comprehensive Coding Scheme for the Optimized SPAADIA Corpus Annotation System
I. Theoretical Foundation
The optimized annotation system for the SPAADIA corpus is grounded in a cognitive-pragmatic framework that conceptualizes service dialogues as dynamic processes of frame activation and strategic meaning negotiation. This theoretical integration synthesizes elements from Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982), Relevance Theory (Sperber & Wilson, 1995), and Construal Theory (Langacker, 2008) to create a multidimensional analytical apparatus capable of capturing the complex interplay between institutional constraints and individual agency in service interactions.

# Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Analysis Framework

## Hypothesis System

### Hypothesis 1: Dual Mechanism Hypothesis of Frame Activation

**Theoretical Statement**: Frame activation in service dialogues embodies a dynamic balance between cognitive flexibility and institutional normativity, manifested through the joint operation of context dependency and institutional presetting, with the relative influence of these two mechanisms varying systematically across dialogue stages.

**Falsifiability Statement**: If the interaction term between context dependency and institutional presetting is not significant (*p* > .05), or if the relative influence of the two mechanisms shows no significant difference across dialogue stages (Wald *χ²* test for stage × mechanism interaction *p* > .05), the hypothesis is rejected.

**Operational Definitions**: Context dependency is measured through the Context Dependency Index (0-1), reflecting the sensitivity of frame activation to immediate contextual cues, calculated based on the semantic relevance between turn content and preceding turns. Institutional presetting is measured through the Institutional Presetting Index (0-1), reflecting the degree of normalization and standardization of frame activation, calculated based on the match with organizational discourse templates. Dialogue stages are divided into opening (relative position 0-0.10), information exchange (0.11-0.40), problem-solving (0.41-0.80), and closing (0.81-1.00). Dynamic balance is reflected through the variation in the ratio of the two standardized indices across different stages.

### Hypothesis 2: Frame-Driven Strategy Selection Hypothesis

**Theoretical Statement**: Frame types as cognitive schemas significantly predict participants' strategy selection, but the strength and direction of this predictive relationship are systematically moderated by participants' institutional roles and dialogue progression stages.

**Falsifiability Statement**: If the main effect of frame type is not significant in multinomial logistic regression (all contrasts *p* > .05), or if the three-way interaction of frame × role × stage is not significant by likelihood ratio test (*χ²* test *p* > .05), the hypothesis is rejected.

**Operational Definitions**: Frame types include service initiation, information provision, transaction, and relational, using effect coding (-1, 0, 1) with transaction frame as the reference category due to its central position in service interactions. Strategy types include reinforcement, shift, blend, response, and resistance as multinomial dependent variables, with reinforcement strategy as the reference category due to its highest frequency. Participant role is coded as a binary variable: service provider (1) vs. customer (0). Dialogue stages adopt the same four-stage division as Hypothesis 1 to ensure cross-hypothesis consistency.

### Hypothesis 3: Path Dependence Hypothesis of Strategy Evolution

**Theoretical Statement**: Strategy selection exhibits time-dependent dynamic evolution characteristics, manifested as significant diagonal dominance in the conditional probability distribution of strategy transitions and time decay effects where strategy effectiveness diminishes with repeated use. These path dependence patterns show systematic differences between participant roles.

**Falsifiability Statement**: If the diagonal dominance of the strategy transition probability matrix is not significant after 1000 permutation tests (*p* > .05), or if the negative prediction of repetition count on effectiveness is not significant in panel data analysis (*β* ≥ 0, *p* > .05), the hypothesis is rejected.

**Operational Definitions**: Path dependence is measured through a 5×5 strategy transition probability matrix, calculating conditional probabilities of each strategy transitioning to others, with diagonal values representing strategy persistence probabilities. Strategy effectiveness is measured through a composite index including immediate acceptance rate (whether the other party accepts the strategy in the next turn, binary variable) and topic progression degree (1-5 scale based on information increment and goal proximity), weighted average. Temporal evolution is tracked through relative turn position (0-1 continuous value), allowing cross-dialogue comparison. Cognitive load index (1-10 continuous scale) serves as an independent cognitive mechanism indicator, assessed based on turn complexity, information density, and processing requirements.

### Hypothesis 4: Semantic Convergence Hypothesis of Meaning Negotiation

**Theoretical Statement**: Meaning construction in service dialogues is achieved through gradual convergence of semantic distance between participants' stances. This convergence process shows nonlinear change patterns at key negotiation points, with trajectory patterns systematically influenced by participant contribution dynamics and negotiation strategies.

**Falsifiability Statement**: If semantic distance at dialogue end is not significantly lower than at the beginning (paired *t* test *p* > .05), or if slope changes at negotiation points are not significant in piecewise regression analysis (*F* test *p* > .05), the hypothesis is rejected.

**Operational Definitions**: Semantic distance is measured through Semantic Distance Value (0-1), using cosine distance based on Word2Vec embeddings to calculate semantic differences between participants' key stance expressions, with manual verification to ensure validity. Negotiation points include five types of key moments: frame establishment, challenge, resolution, closure, and termination, each with clear discourse markers and sequential features. Contribution dynamics are measured through moving averages of contribution rates (window size = 5 turns) and coefficient of variation, reflecting temporal patterns of participant dominance. Convergence trajectories are captured through multilevel piecewise growth models, allowing slope changes at each negotiation point.

## Statistical Analysis Framework

### Statistical Power and Sample Size Analysis

Based on the sample size of 35 dialogues and 6,053 turns, a priori power analysis was conducted. Using G*Power 3.1.9.7 and the simr package (1.0.5) for multilevel model power estimation, results show that at *α* = 0.05 level, the current sample size can detect medium effect sizes for fixed effects (*f²* = 0.15) and random effects explaining more than 5% of variance with 80% power. For more complex three-way interaction effects, statistical power decreases to 60-70%. This limitation means small effect size interactions may not be detected, which will be discussed in detail in the limitations section.

### Hypothesis 1 Testing: Multilevel Mixed Effects Model

The main analysis employs a three-level linear mixed model with the complete model specification: Frame activation strength ~ Context dependency + Institutional presetting + Dialogue stage + Context dependency × Institutional presetting + Dialogue stage × Context dependency + Dialogue stage × Institutional presetting + Dialogue stage × Context dependency × Institutional presetting + (1 + Context dependency|Speaker/Dialogue). The model includes random intercepts and random slopes at both speaker and dialogue levels, allowing for individual differences in context sensitivity.

Key tests focus on the interaction effects between stages and mechanisms. By calculating standardized regression coefficients for each stage and comparing their relative magnitudes, the dynamic changes in the influence of the two mechanisms are quantified. Kenward-Roger approximation is used for degrees of freedom to handle small sample inference. Effect sizes are assessed by calculating the relative contribution rates of the two mechanisms within each stage (based on ratios of standardized coefficients).

### Hypothesis 2 Testing: Multilevel Multinomial Logistic Regression

A progressive model-building strategy is adopted, adding predictors from simple to complex. The base model (M1) includes only the main effect of frame type, the extended model (M2) adds main effects of role and stage, the interaction model (M3) adds all two-way interactions, and the complete model (M4) includes the key three-way interaction. Model improvements at each step are evaluated through likelihood ratio tests, requiring *p* < .05 and AIC reduction of more than 2 units to retain more complex models.

To interpret the substantive meaning of interaction effects, marginal effects of each frame type on strategy selection are calculated under different combinations of role and stage. Effect plots visualize the three-way interaction, showing how predicted probabilities vary with combinations of frame type, role, and stage. All models include dialogue efficiency indicators and strategy diversity indices as dialogue-level control variables, fully utilizing meta-analytic coding information.

### Hypothesis 3 Testing: Mixed Methods Analysis

Markov chain analysis first constructs separate 5×5 strategy transition probability matrices for service providers and customers. Statistical significance of diagonal dominance is assessed using 1000 permutation tests, randomly shuffling strategy sequences and recalculating transition probabilities in each permutation to construct the null distribution. The *p* value is obtained by calculating the position of the observed diagonal mean in the null distribution. Steady-state distributions and mean first passage times are compared to assess differences in long-term behavior of strategy systems between roles.

Strategy effectiveness analysis employs fixed effects panel data models with speaker as the panel unit, controlling for unobserved individual heterogeneity. The dependent variable is the standardized strategy effectiveness composite index, with key predictors including strategy repetition count (testing decay effects), quadratic term of repetition count (testing nonlinear relationships), and the interaction between repetition count and role (testing role differences). Control variables include cognitive load index, current frame type, relative turn position, and preceding strategy type.

### Hypothesis 4 Testing: Piecewise Growth Curve Model

The main analysis employs multilevel piecewise regression models, allowing changes in the rate of semantic distance variation at each negotiation point. The model includes five potential breakpoints corresponding to five types of negotiation points. Grid search is used to determine optimal breakpoint positions, evaluating models with different numbers of breakpoints through AIC and BIC. Dialogue-specific random intercepts and slopes capture individual differences.

Sensitivity analyses include three aspects. First, different semantic distance calculation methods (e.g., TF-IDF-based cosine similarity) are used to verify result robustness. Second, different parameter settings for the CUSUM algorithm (control limits from 1.5 to 3.0 standard deviations) are employed to detect change points, verifying correspondence between identified change points and coded negotiation points. Third, goodness of fit is compared across linear, quadratic, and piecewise models to ensure the necessity of piecewise modeling.

### Inter-hypothesis Relationship Testing: Extended Path Analysis

A theoretical model including feedback paths is constructed, encompassing not only the forward causal chain H1→H2→H3→H4 but also the feedback path H4→H2, reflecting how successful semantic convergence may facilitate subsequent strategy adjustment. Using a structural equation modeling framework, all path coefficients are simultaneously estimated through maximum likelihood estimation. Bootstrap with 1000 replications is used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for indirect and total effects.

Model fit is evaluated using multiple indices, including *χ²*/*df* ratio (< 3 acceptable), CFI (> 0.95 good), RMSEA (< 0.06 good), and SRMR (< 0.08 good). Modification indices identify potential model improvements, but paths are added only when theoretically justified. Multi-group analysis tests invariance of path coefficients across different subgroups (e.g., different service types).

## Data Processing and Analysis Implementation Details

### Missing Data Handling Strategy

For randomly missing data points (e.g., individual turns unidentifiable due to recording quality), multiple imputation (*m* = 5) is implemented using the mice package (3.14.0). The imputation model includes all analysis variables, using predictive mean matching for continuous variables and logistic regression for binary variables. For systematic missingness (e.g., some dialogues lacking specific stages), complete case analysis is used in main analyses with sensitivity analyses to assess impact on results. Overall missing rate is expected to be below 5%, not producing substantial impact on results.

### Multiple Comparison Correction

Given the large number of statistical tests involved, a hierarchical multiple comparison correction strategy is adopted. For multiple tests within the same hypothesis, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is used to control false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05 level. For exploratory analyses, uncorrected *p* values are reported but explicitly noted as uncorrected in interpretation. Key theoretical tests (e.g., main interaction effects) are not corrected to maintain statistical power, but interpreted considering the overall multiple testing context.

### Computational Resources and Time Estimation

Implementing the complete analysis requires substantial computational resources. Data preprocessing and variable construction are estimated to require 40-60 hours of programming and debugging time. In the statistical analysis phase, multilevel model estimation requires 5-10 minutes per complete model (using Intel i7 processor), 1000 permutation tests require 2-3 hours, and path analysis model bootstrap with 1000 replications requires 1-2 hours. Total analysis time is estimated at 80-100 hours, requiring a computer with at least 16GB RAM and multi-core processor. High-performance computing clusters are recommended for computationally intensive analyses.

### Result Presentation and Interpretation Principles

Result reporting strictly follows APA 7th edition format requirements. For multilevel models, report unstandardized coefficients (*b*), standard errors (*SE*), 95% confidence intervals, and standardized coefficients (*β*) for fixed effects. For random effects, report variance components (*σ²*) and correlation coefficients (*r*). Effect sizes use multiple indicators to ensure comprehensive understanding: Cohen's *d* for between-group comparisons of continuous variables, odds ratios for categorical outcomes, *R²* and pseudo-*R²* for model explanatory power. All major findings are accompanied by high-quality visualizations using ggplot2 (3.3.6) to ensure publication quality, with figures including complete statistical information and confidence intervals.

### Software Environment and Reproducibility Assurance

All analyses are conducted in standardized computing environments to ensure reproducibility. Main analyses use Python 3.9.7 with key package versions including: statsmodels 0.13.5 (multilevel modeling), scikit-learn 1.0.2 (machine learning algorithms), pandas 1.4.2 (data processing), numpy 1.21.5 (numerical computation), matplotlib 3.5.1 and seaborn 0.11.2 (data visualization). Some specialized analyses use R 4.2.1, including lme4 1.1-29 (validating multilevel models), lavaan 0.6-11 (structural equation models), mice 3.14.0 (multiple imputation). Complete analysis scripts, data, and environment configuration files are publicly shared through GitHub (https://github.com/chenwangfang/A-Multilevel-Logistic-Regression-Analysis), including detailed README files guiding analysis reproduction.

### Ethical Review and Data Protection

Although this study uses the publicly available SPAADIA corpus, strict ethical standards are followed. All participant identity information has been completely anonymized in the original corpus. As a secondary analysis, this study follows the original data use protocol without additional ethical risks. During analysis, if any potentially identifying information is discovered (e.g., specific place names, personal names), it is immediately deleted or further anonymized in the working dataset. Data storage follows GDPR requirements, using encrypted storage and transmission.

### Comprehensive Analysis Flow Description

To visually demonstrate the complex analysis design, a complete analysis flowchart is created (see Figure 1). The flow begins with the raw SPAADIA corpus, processed through the XML-JSON hybrid annotation system to generate structured datasets. Data preprocessing includes variable construction, missing value handling, and data validation. Main analyses proceed in parallel according to the four hypotheses, with each hypothesis including main analyses and sensitivity tests. Finally, findings from the four hypotheses are integrated through path analysis to form a complete theoretical model. This flow design ensures systematic and traceable analysis.
